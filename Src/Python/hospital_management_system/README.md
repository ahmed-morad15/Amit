# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A **professional, modular, and extensible Hospital Management System** built with **Python** following solid **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The project provides both a **Console-Based Interface** and a **modern Streamlit Web Dashboard**, making it suitable for academic projects, demonstrations, and real-world system design practice.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

* Dual Interface: **Console + Web GUI**
* Clean OOP architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Multi-hospital support
* Role-based staff management (Doctors, Nurses, Admins)
* Interactive Streamlit dashboard
* Scalable and future-ready design

---

## 📋 Dual Interface Architecture

### 🖥️ Console Interface

A classic command-line interface that allows full system control via structured menus. Ideal for learning OOP design, testing logic, and running the system in low-resource environments.

### 🌐 Streamlit Web Interface

A modern, user-friendly dashboard built with **Streamlit**, offering:

* Visual metrics and summaries
* Interactive forms and workflows
* Sidebar-based navigation
* Professional UI suitable for demos and presentations

## 🏥 System Overview

The Hospital Management System handles core hospital operations, including:

* Patient registration and admission
* Department and staff organization
* Doctor-patient assignments
* Medical record tracking
* Administrative and reporting operations

The system supports **multiple hospitals**, each operating independently under a unified management layer.

---

## 🧩 UML Design

The system is designed using UML-driven development to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
